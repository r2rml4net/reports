## Implementation report of contemporary R2RML/DM tools

[![Built with open-wc recommendations](https://img.shields.io/badge/built%20with-open--wc-blue.svg)](https://github.com/open-wc)

## Listed implementations

1. [r2rml4net](https://github.com/r2rml4net/r2rml4net)
2. *read below to add your implementation*

## Why?

The official R2RML Implementation report has not been updated since 2012. Many new tools have appeared and the old implementations are largely abandoned, outdated or evolved into something else.

This and sibling repositories aim to provide a new, up to date outlook on the R2RML ecosystem.

## Have your tool listed!

To have your imnplemenation of R2RML/Direct Mapping tool, open a PR to this repo by adding links to your EARL reports in the [src/reports.js](./src/reports.js) file. As soon as the PR is merged your tool will be added to the list.

You can add multiple reports for you tool (for example separate to DM/R2RML and for every tested RDBMS). They will all be combined as a single column.

## Generating reports

If you don't have the reports ready you can create a new repo from [r2rml4net/test-runner](https://github.com/r2rml4net/test-runner). Check the [r2rml4net's setup](https://github.com/r2rml4net/r2rml4net-implementation-report) for an example of configuring your CI process.
