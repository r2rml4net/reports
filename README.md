## Have your tool listed

To have your imnplemenation of R2RML/Direct Mapping tool, open a PR to this repo by adding links to your EARL reports in the [src/reports.js](./src/reports.js) file. As soon as the PR is merged your tool will be added to the list.

You can add multiple reports for you tool (for example separate to DM/R2RML and for every tested RDBMS)

## Generating reports

If you don't have the reports ready you can create a new repo from [r2rml4net/test-runner](https://github.com/r2rml4net/test-runner). Check the [r2rml4net's setup](https://github.com/r2rml4net/r2rml4net-implementation-report) for an example of configuring your CI process.
